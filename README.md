# AppDevProject
App Development Class Final Project

Files contain prototype app of our final project. 

FetchData.js fetches data from our google sheet under my account.

Data.js pulls data into containers in the last navigation screen.

Regform.js will be a form that writes information into our google sheet through the use of the google sheets api.

app.js contains all styles, functions and navigation. 



Most of this is still very basic, we must work on the layout and appearance of it once we get the functionality of the app working 100%.
